# CineRecs
This project is a web application built to recommend movies and TV shows to users based on their preferences. The app leverages the TMDb (The Movie Database) API to fetch and display personalized recommendations. Users can enter their preferred genres or other filters, and the application will display a list of recommended movies and TV shows.
